# text-based-RPG
A simple text based RPG game written in Python and some JSON. Inspired by the EPIC RPG Discord Bot.

This RPG runs in a Python Console window. It is a small hobby project I'm working on.

# What can you do?
You can hunt and fight monsters, have a big fight with a boss, buy new armor, level up, and get more XP for whatever's in your bank!
